# DietPlanner
 A web application designed to help users achieve their health and wellness goals through personalized diet plans and a vast database of nutritious recipes. 
 
## Key Features

### Recipe Database
Access to a wide database of dietary recipes with the option to filter by calorie content, preparation time, and diet types.

#### Search recipes by calorie content
Users can filter recipes based on calorie content. This option allows you to quickly find dishes that fall within a specific calorie range. This allows users to easily tailor their diet to their individual health and diet goals.

#### Filter by preparation time
This feature allows users to search for recipes based on how long they take to prepare. The ability to set a preferred time frame makes it easy to find dishes that are suitable for planned meals, whether itâ€™s a quick lunch or a more elaborate dinner.

#### Selection by diet type
The recipe database also allows you to filter by diet type, which is especially useful for people who follow special dietary rules, such as vegan, gluten-free, ketogenic. Users can easily find recipes that meet their dietary preferences and needs.
